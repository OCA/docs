title: Welcome to OCA docs
---
Here you will find documentation for some [OCA](https://odoo-community.org/) modules.
Hopefully, some day, for all of them.

All docs are licensed under the [CC-BY-4.0 license](./LICENSE.txt).

🚧 This site was a **prototype**. See [the plan](https://github.com/OCA/docs/issues/5). We needed help! 🚧

... but we didn't get it.

Thus, [this project was abandoned and archived](https://github.com/OCA/docs/issues/46).
